Netflix-clone-App-Made-from-Reactjs-with-Firebase-Backend
Used TMDB API Key for Movies database and intergrated into this App. Played around the API Key, Understood How API works.

This project is built with React.js as front end framework and Firebase as a backend. In this project I have used UseEffect, UseState React Hooks , &

Used Component Based Structure for build most UI,

Used the Material UI for Buttons, Avatar, Icons.
